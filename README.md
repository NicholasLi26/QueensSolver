QueensSolver is a logic puzzle solver for the LinkedIn game Queens written in Java Using Swing componenets for GUI. <br />
It utilizes written logic checks similar to how one would solve it manually. Currently up to a 10x10 puzzle can be inputted, but larger puzzles will soon be implemented. <br />
Still a work in progress, with new checks still being added. It is also still being optimized, with runtime being around n^3 on most executions.<br />
Even so, it is relatively efficient, with execution time ranging from 6-10 on up to 10x10 puzzles.
